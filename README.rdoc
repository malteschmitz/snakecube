== SnakeCube

The target of this project is to implement an evolutionary algorithm that
finds the fittest two-dimensional configuration of a snake cube.

Fitness is defined using two different fitness functions.

An Evolution ruby class is used to ruby evolutionary algorithms based on
individuals represented as bitvectors (which are internally stored as numbers).
